# Project Description
The goal of this analysis is to evaluate Breweries and Beers across the US. A thorough analysis of the data was conducted which included finding the number of Breweries, addressing missing values, and exploring the importance of International Business unit (IBU) and Alcohol by volume (ABV). Conclusion and inferences will be drawn from the summary statistics and relationships between IBU and ABV.

# Analysis Questions

Why are there missing values?

What is the median ABV and IBU for each state?

Which state has the highest ABV and which state has the highest IBU values?
